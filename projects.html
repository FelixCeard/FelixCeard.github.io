                    <span>Programming language</span>

                    <p>
                        I created my own esoteric programming language called Eb-maj7.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The goal of this programming language was to be able to write functional code and during the
                        execution, music would have been created.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The syntax is very weird as I have (rather had) the plan of converting the execution code to a
                        MIDI file at execution time which would have enabled the user to listen to their program.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In the end, I (only) programmed an interpreter in python (python 3.10s match statements omg soo
                        good!) which is able to execute the syntax as it should.
                        <br>
                        Even though the syntax is weird, I find it quite interesting as for example, my programming
                        language has only two variables, which is a direct analogy with pianists, who only have two
                        hands to play.
                        <br>
                        The picture gives an accurate representation how it feels to program with this language.
                        <br>

                    <span>Neural Network framework</span>

                    <p>
                        Having learned functional programming languages in programming one, I wanted to see the limits
                        of this kind of languages, and I challenged myself to create of framework for the training of
                        neural networks.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Because we used an unpopular programming language (SML), it meant that there was no ground
                        truth, so technically I would be the first one to implement gradient descent in this programming
                        language. Note that everything in this "library" is implemented from scratch, including matrix
                        multiplication etc...
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My framework is able to train a neural network of any desired size but only consisting of fully
                        connected layers, Relu
                        and sigmoid activation functions.
                        <br>

                    <span>Transformer</span>

                    <p>
                        For the course <a href="https://cms.sic.saarland/hlcvss22/">High Level Computer Vision</a>, I am
                        doing a project involving training a large transformer from scratch.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The goal of the project is to recreate pictures of objects solely on their sketches. Even though
                        this task is not novel, we used the VQ-GAN architecture to introduce a novel approach to this
                        domain.
                        <br>
                        The advantage of using a transformer instead of a "classic" GAN is that, in theory, it would be
                        able to not only recreate the images based on their sketches, but also to create the sketches
                        from the images. I believe, that with enough data and a bigger transformer, this transformer
                        could excel in both (sub-)tasks.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For our dataset, we used a dataset of <a
                            href="https://amazon-berkeley-objects.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html"> 400 thousand amazon
                        product images</a> that we converted with a <a href="https://mtli.github.io/sketch/">second
                        AI</a> to sketches.
                        <br>
                        I used a pretrained VQ-VAE (as described <a
                            href="https://github.com/CompVis/taming-transformers">here</a>) which is able to correctly
                        encode and decode both our images and sketches.
                        I Therefore "just" have to train a Transformer, the architecture I am using has 27 millions
                        parameter.
                        <br>
                        To train this model, it takes around 7-8 hours per epoch. A detailed version of the training can
                        be found in this report: <a

                    <p>
                        I stumbled (somewhat on accident) on a version of <a href="">Game of Life</a> that is in the
                        continuous domain (this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wDSQxmAyTw&t=361s">YouTube
                        video</a> may help understand what this is all about).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I saw a project on YouTube where someone applied reinforcement learning on the original Game of
                        Life, in order to discover new <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns">patterns</a>.
                        <br>
                        My goal was to recreate this project, but instead of using a discrete space, I would like to use
                        the continuous domain.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As this is computationally intensive (O(n^2)), I wanted to optimize the simulation to run on my
                        GPU.
                        <br>
                        In the end, I improved the performance from 30s per frame to around 60-70 frames per seconds.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                    <span>Gravity simulation</span>

                    <p>
                        I create a simulation for the (famous) "n-body problem", which simply states that the gravity
                        between multiple objects (planets) cannot be computed analytically (or fast, sth. along those
                        line).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This naive approach is an approximation of this problem. Unlike the stated problem, I did not
                        focus on the problem itself, but rather on the artistic style of the simulation, as it is very
                        satisfying to see how these planets behave.

                        It is noteworthy that I implemented an image scrapper a few years ago, nothing fancy, it just
