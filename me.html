                    Hello!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Felix here. I am 19 years old, studying data science and artificial intelligence at the University
                    of Saarland, and working as a research assistant for the German Research Center for Artificial
                    Intelligence (DFKI).

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Having followed the latest research since high school, I believe in AI that benefits humanity rather
                    than replacing it. As a result, I believe in researching AI systems that supplement human skill sets
                    rather than attempting to mimic humans with large and expensive AIs.
                    This is why, among other reasons, I have decided to join the DFKI's interactive machine learning
                    department in 2021. There, I published one demo, which was accepted at the HHAI conference, which
                    (as the name implies) is concerned with hybrid AI and explainable features.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Aside from working on my own projects, I enjoy a variety of hobbies, including playing the guitar
                    for over 12 years and basketball for 7 years.
